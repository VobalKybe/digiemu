## 0. Setup and smoke test (5 minutes)

```sh
uv sync                     # creates .venv on CPython 3.12 from uv.lock

# decompress the sections out of the .syx (about a second)
uv run python -m emu.extract Digitakt_II_OS1.15C.syx -o sections/

uv run python -m dt2.container Digitakt_II_OS1.15C.syx   # section table
uv run python emu/oracle.py                              # CRC oracle, seconds
uv run python emu/screen.py selftest                     # graphics, seconds
uv run python -m emu.softfloat                           # float HLE vs firmware
uv run python -m emu.hle                                 # bitmap HLE vs firmware
```

All three should pass. If `oracle.py` throws `UC_ERR_MAP`, see Trap 3 below.

Then watch it boot:

```sh
uv run python -m emu.gui                      # live panel in a window
uv run python -m emu.frame snapshots/boot400M.snap 20000000   # one frame, ASCII + PNG
```

**Why the Python version is pinned.** `pyproject.toml` requires 3.12, not the
3.14 Homebrew installs by default. Two reasons, both practical: binary wheels
are still thin on 3.14 (pygame, for one, only resolves to an sdist), and
Homebrew's `python@3.14` ships no `tkinter`, so `emu/gui.py` could not open a
window. uv's managed CPython bundles tkinter, so `uv sync` is the whole setup
-- no `brew install` step.

## 2. Work item A — the emulator

### Honest ceiling -- REVISED, the old one was measuring a bug

The previous version of this file said full boot was "not reachable on a useful
timescale", from "1 new task per ~250M instructions, and the gaps are widening".
That was not the firmware. It was `raise_vector` pushing the wrong PC into
`trap #0` exception frames, so any task that blocked could never be resumed.
See "The scheduler never worked" in FINDINGS. With that fixed:

- distinct TCBs scheduled went **1 -> 5**
- throughput is **~2.1-2.8M instr/sec** (scoped ISA hooks), not 0.83M
- the panel **draws**: 84 frames through the firmware's own `Bitmap::setPixel`

What is still true: no device interrupt ever fires under emulation, so with
faithful semantics every task eventually parks on a semaphore only real
hardware would post. That is a modelling gap, not a time budget.

**Two levers, both already wired:**

- `longrun.build(unblock=True)` force-satisfies any pend whose count is <= 0.
  This is what makes the draw task draw. It changes semantics -- nothing ever
  really waits -- so inter-task ordering under it is not the hardware's, and it
  is wrong to enable before ~400M (it livelocks the early boot).
- the boot-mode flag word at `0x40288190`: setting bit 5 creates the serial
  console task. Bit 6 is a deliberate halt; leave it clear.

**Fidelity rule, learned the hard way:** resuming a snapshot requires the same
*hook set*, not just the same Machine. `spin()` must not inject ticks at chunk
boundaries -- vector 32 is `trap #0`, so that forces a reschedule inside
arbitrary code and the run silently diverges. `build()` now installs the depack
clamp and idle-spin ticks to match `dspboot.run`; verified by reproducing the
from-entry task-creation timeline exactly.

### What *is* worth doing

1. **Use snapshots as the normal working mode.** Never re-run from entry.
   ```sh
   uv run python -m emu.checkpoint make 60000000,120000000,200000000,280000000
   uv run python -m emu.longrun snapshots/boot280M.snap 200000000
   ```
   `boot280M.snap` carries 9 tasks / 47,335 addresses and resumes in ~10 s.


3. **Speed, if you want it.** Profile which hooks cost most — the UART
   `UC_HOOK_MEM_READ/WRITE` and the `SWITCH_TO` hook are the prime suspects for
   the 3x loss. Dropping to only the hooks a given experiment needs should
   recover most of the bare-run throughput.

### Concrete open leads

- **Console: WORKS.** `uv run python -m emu.serial console '#HELLO'` ->
  `HOW DO YOU DO?`. The queue item is
  a **pointer to a NUL-terminated string** (the console does
  `sscanf(item,"%s",buf)` then strcmp), which is why routing the raw serial
  byte stream at it dispatched but never matched. `emu.serial.send_command`
  enqueues via the firmware's own `queue_send`. Needs bit 5 of `0x40288190`
  set so the console task exists.

- **Console, the DMA input path (still worth finishing).**
  UART8 receive never touches the CPU -- eDMA channel 34 writes into a
  1024-byte ring at `0x4FE1A000` and vector 154 drains it against the
  channel's live `DADDR` (`0xFC045450`). `emu/serial.py` injects input that
  way and it is verified: the RX callback fires once per byte and the bytes
  reach the serial queue `0x47D9ADC0`. What is missing is the consumer of that
  queue, the task at `0x401136EE` (prio 3), created lazily by `0x401134CC`
  (guard `0x44F1E070`). `emu.serial.create_serial_task` creates it; it has not
  been seen draining the queue. **Start there:** check whether `task_start`
  (`0x40001314`) runs for tcb `0x44dfccb4` and whether the scheduler selects
  it. PIT counters are never read, so they need no modelling.

- **Console (earlier notes).** Set bit 5 of `0x40288190` before the init task
  reaches `0x400cf384`, resuming from `boot200M`; the task is created and
  starts. It then runs 22 instructions and blocks at
  `jsr $40001928` on the queue at `0x40388eac`. That primitive is a ring buffer:
  it loops while the item count at `4(a2)` is zero, pending on the semaphore at
  `a2+8` (`0x40388eb4`). Posting that semaphore is **not** enough -- an item has
  to be enqueued. The producer reaches the queue by pointer, so pull on the
  registration at `0x400cd5a8` (`jsr $40110592`, object `0x40303e50`).
  Hook `print` at `0x400054b4` to capture output; protocol words start with
  `#` (`#HELLO`), not `help`.

- **The intro should run at 15.00 fps.** Not a guess: PIT3 (`PCSR=0x0936`,
  `PMR=0x2191`) gives 8,800,256 bus cycles per frame, its ISR at vector 208
  posts the semaphore the draw loop waits on, and the bus clock is 132 MHz
  taken from the UART baud divider constant `0x07DE2900` at `0x400024a4`. It
  cross-checks: the same clock makes the RTOS tick exactly 50.000 Hz and PIT2
  60.0 Hz. The GUI reaches ~30% of that and now says so in the status line.
  Note `unblock=True` satisfies the frame semaphore, so what you see is
  unpaced, not 15 fps; see FINDINGS for why driving vector 208 instead does
  not work without cycle accounting.

- **Live real-time is out of reach; use Replay.** With both HLEs we run 312k
  instructions per frame against a 2.90M instr/s Unicorn ceiling, so even with
  zero handler cost the ceiling is 9.3 fps (62% of real time); measured is
  4.43 (30%). Hitting 15 fps needs <=193k instr/frame and the rasteriser alone
  is 159k -- i.e. it would mean not emulating the thing we want to watch. A
  native hook layer or a different core is what that would take.

- **Watch it at true speed now.** The GUI's **Replay 15fps** button plays the
  captured frames back at the firmware's own rate. Emulating at 15 fps needs
  ~3x more throughput than we have, but the frames are pixel-identical to a
  fully emulated run, so replay shows exactly what the device shows.

- **Speed: 3.1x, and the ceiling is understood.** 93% of emulated instructions
  were soft-float; `emu/softfloat.py` and `emu/hle.py` run those and
  setPixel/getPixel natively, bit-exact and verified against the firmware's own
  routines. No hook in this project costs anything measurable. The claim that
  followed -- that Unicorn's m68k core does ~2.2M instr/sec here, so further
  gains must come from executing fewer instructions -- was **wrong, corrected
  2026-09-13**: ~2.2M is the cost of `count=`, not of the core, which does
  15.5M instr/sec uncounted on the same machine. See `longrun._FastStepper`. Both HLEs are
  off by default because they change instruction counts; `FAST=1` for the
  longrun CLI. `install_mmio` was global too and is now scoped (1.33x on the
  fully-emulated path, ~3% on the HLE path). On the HLE path the bottleneck is
  now Python callback dispatch, not Unicorn -- ~88k HLE calls per 12 frames --
  so more speed means cheaper or fewer callbacks, not fewer hooks.

- **Draw path: solved.** `emu/frame.py` from `boot400M` with `unblock=True`
  renders 84 frames into the panel Bitmap at **`0x4313b298`**. The rasteriser
  needed no callable entry point -- only a working scheduler.

- **Text rendering**: still never located. Unchanged from before; the font is
  probably runtime-constructed. Now that the panel actually draws, the cheaper
  attack is to diff `setPixel` traces between UI states rather than hunt for a
  glyph table statically.

- **The five other uncreated tasks** (`0x401136ee` p3, `0x40127c78` p4,
  `0x40127d9e` p4, `0x40127b24` p5, `0x4012606a` p6) are each gated somewhere
  similar; the console one was gated on a single flag bit.

## 5. Traps that already cost time

1. **Capstone 5 silently mis-decodes ColdFire opcodes** — `MVS`/`MVZ` (including
   indexed mode) and `FF1`. A linear sweep loses sync *on the instruction that
   matters* — it sits directly on the bootstrap version gate, and misreading it
   inverts the safety answer. Use `dt2/coldfire.py` or Ghidra's
   `68000:BE:32:Coldfire`.
2. **Unicorn hard-aborts (SIGABRT) on `movec` with Rc=0x009** — not a catchable
   fault. Must be intercepted before Unicorn's decoder sees it. Handled in
   `harness.py`; do not remove.
3. **Write `SR` before `A7`.** m68k banks SSP/USP, so switching mode after
   setting the stack pointer writes the register the CPU is about to stop using.
   Surfaces as a bogus `UC_ERR_MAP`.
4. **Resume snapshots *into* a hooked machine.** Restoring onto a bare `Machine`
   drops the behaviour hooks and the run diverges while looking plausible
   (~50 addresses over 5M instructions). Use `dspboot.run(resume_from=...)`.
5. **A wrong `PixelData` renders as plausible dither, not an error.** Validate
   rendering against ground truth (`emu/screen.py selftest`), never by eye.
6. **Check byte-position histograms before interpreting a buffer.** The intro
   buffer was read as floats and described as a dither field; only byte 3 of each
   word is ever non-zero — they are integer `(x, y)` coordinates.
7. **Vector 32 is `trap #0`.** Injecting it as a "timer tick" forces a
   scheduler reschedule inside whatever code is running. It is not a timer, and
   using it as one makes resumed runs diverge from the runs that produced their
   snapshots. Tick idle spins instead (`build()` does).
8. **A resumed run needs the same hooks, not just the same Machine.** Trap 4
   above is the loud version; the quiet version is a *missing* hook -- `build()`
   lacking the depack clamp and idle-spin ticks changed where boot went without
   any error surfacing.
9. **"Stalled" metrics lie.** The stall detector flags any hot address after a
   window with no *new* coverage, so ordinary hot arithmetic (`__mulsf3` at
   `0x40175288`) reads as a hang.
10. **`ERROR_headerVersion_wrong`** and friends in MAIN OS are the **LZ4 frame
   error enum**, not OS versioning. A false lead.
